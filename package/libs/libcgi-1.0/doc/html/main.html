<center><h2><u>LibCGI - CGI easy as C</u></h2></center><br>
Hello!<br>
My name is <b>Rafael Steil</b>, I'm from <b>Brazil</b>. <br><br>

I started programming LibCGI just for fun at september/2001. The reason
I wrote this lib was, originally, to learn more about C programming. In that time, I had many
problems with pointers manipulation, and I was being a bit bored about it. 
<br>
I needed a reason, 
a good reason continue. Those days I've been coding in PHP, and I sill like PHP a lot, because it is powerful
and fun to code with. But on the other hand, I don't want to work with PHP for the rest of my life,
I want to do something of exciting, like programming games :). <br><br>
Just as curiosity, currently I spend my time ( which means, I'm paid for ) coding in Java and C#.
<br><br>
When I wrote the first LibCGI's line of code  ( in this time LibCGI was just a test program ),
I knew absolutely nothing about CGI programming, I didn't know how to read form variables, nothing.<br>
After some time searching in the Internet, I found some cool papers, and one of them described how to 
read data, and before reading it, I thought "sucks, It seems to be really complex", but not, I was 
wrong! How fun!! After some hours I finished a more complex program,
that reads from STDIN and parses it! So I thought "why not make a lib???". 
<br><br>
Great! I had one more reason
to code in C. At that time, I was already codding much better, and I was safe that could do 
something very cool!

Now, the result is LibCGI. I would like to thank to everyone that
send me suggestions, bugs and bug-fixes, well, to everyone that uses LibCGI. Thanks a lot guys.!!
