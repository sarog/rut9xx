1) There is a makefile ( Makefile ). Use it to compile the library and examples
2) To compile the library, just type "make" (whithout the quotes) in the 
directory that you have decompressed the library
3) To clean, type make clean
4) To remove library files, type make uninstall
5) Into examples/ directory are some examples. 
6) Well.. the basic idea is it. If you have any kind of problem
or questions/sugestions, please send me an email 
( rafael@insanecorp.com ). Your help is very welcome!
